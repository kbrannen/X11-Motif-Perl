The basic approach I've been following is to implement the C interfaces
to the various libraries as faithfully as possible while avoiding some
of the traps that the original designers were forced to live with
because of C's limitations.  The argument lists used to pass resources
to many Xt and Xm functions are a good example.  In the C libraries, a
programmer has to carefully set up some rather cumbersome data
structures before calling these functions.  The Perl module eliminates
the need to do this and accepts the resources in normal Perl "list"
context.  This gives the interface the flavor of the variable length
argument version of the C routines, but with complete safety, i.e. there
is no need to provide a terminating NULL and the argument types are
checked before use.

In addition to the standard C-like interface, I've added a more
object-oriented syntax.  Currently, only the Toolkit module (i.e. widget
oriented functions) has this alternate syntax.  The OO syntax permits a
much simpler, more concise programming style.  It is quite similar to
Tk.  Compare the two approaches with a Motif PushButton example:

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # This is fairly standard Motif.  The Perl interface is much easier
  # to use than the C interface because XmStrings are automatically
  # created and destroyed and callbacks can be anonymous subroutines.

    my $button = XtCreateManagedWidget("button", xmPushButtonWidgetClass, $parent,
					XmNlabelString, 'OK',
					XmNlabelType, XmSTRING);

    XtAddCallback($button, XmNactivateCallback, sub { exit }, 0);

    ...

    if (XtIsManaged($button)) {
       XtSetValues($button, XmNbackground, 'yellow');
    }

  # However, Motif is still cumbersome because there are lots of
  # functions and resource names.  The OO Widget interface improves this
  # by providing fewer, more powerful functions and short alias names
  # for common resources.  In this example, by setting the text alias
  # the widget's XmNlabelString and XmNlabelType attributes are both changed.
  # The callback is also registered at widget creation time instead of in
  # a separate command.

    my $button = give $parent -button, -text => 'OK', -command => sub { exit };

    ...

    if (query $button -managed) {
       change $button -bg => 'yellow';
    }

  # The "query $button" statement above might be more readable if this coding
  # style is used:

    if ($button->IsManaged) {
       change $button -bg => 'yellow';
    }

  # Well, at least C++ programmers might find it more readible...

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd like to do something similar for the basic X interface as well.  X
programmers desperately need a higher level drawing interface to
automatically manage graphic contexts and exposures.  There are many freely
available libraries that this work could be based on.

As shown above, you can create a widget using give(), see X11/Toolkit/Widget.pm.
There is also an alias to that named create_widget() if that feels more normal.
That would make the example above to be:

    my $button = create_widget $parent -button, -text => 'OK', -command => sub { exit };
    -or-
    my $button = create_widget($parent, "-button", -text => 'OK', -command => sub { exit });

To see all of the "other" interfaces that you're likely to want to use, you'll want
to go look at (blib/lib/auto/) X11/Toolkit/Widget.pm and search for "Utility functions".

    Realize $widget
    Manage $widget
    Unmanage $widget
    $ac = GetContext $widget   # get ApplicationContext
    $name = FullName $widget   # get full parent tree
    $bool = IsManaged $widget  # experimental!

    change $widget resource => value, ...
    synth_get_name $widget
    synth_get_parent $widget
    synth_get_managed $widget
    synth_set_mapped $widget
    $widget = give parent type resource => value, ...
    $widget = create_widget parent type resource => value, ...
    constrain $widget resource => value, ...
    (value, ...) = query $widget resource, ...
    handle $widget # tell the widget to display itself and then start handling
                   # all input events.
    set_inherited_resources $widget

    XtAddCallback($widget, $cb_name, $proc, $client_data)
    XtSetValues($widget, resource, value, ...)
    @a = XtGetValues($widget, resource, ...)

If you want to know what the widget aliases (e.g. that "-button" maps to
xmPushButtonWidgetClass, then see X11/Motif.pm. As a list, there is:

    -bulletinboard
    -button
    -canvas
    -dialog
    -dialogshell
    -drawingarea
    -editor
    -field
    -folder
    -form
    -frame
    -label
    -linedarea
    -list
    -menu
    -menubar
    -menushell
    -optionmenu
    -pane
    -popupmenu
    -rowcolumn
    -scrolledwindow
    -separator
    -spacer
    -stack
    -text
    -toggle
    -toplevel
    -transient

New 2.x widgets that aren't yet implemented are:

* Container/Icon Gadget that is used to provide both tabular and iconic
  presentations of a hierarchy of objects that can be used to build
  file/directory managers
* Notebook used to create property sheets or multi-page documents with tabs
* Spinbox used for cycling through sets of choices such as setting dates and times
* Combo Box/Drop Down Combo Box/Drop Down List are Motif versions of
  standard PC widgets that allow a user to choose or enter a value
* Thermometer for showing the progress of a task.
