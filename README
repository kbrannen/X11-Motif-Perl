--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is version 1.9 of a Perl interface to:

  * the X11 C library
  * the X11 Toolkit
  * the Xpm pixmap library
  * the OSF Motif widget set (version 2.x)
  * the Xbae widget set (used with Motif)

To build the release:

  1. Edit config.pm to customize the compilation options to your
     site.  The default configuration is for Linux with Xbae & Xpm.

     If you are on a system that is not already defined in the
     config.pm, please send me the necessary changes so it is
     supported in a future release.  Thanks!

  2. Run "perl Makefile.PL".  Make sure that you are running perl
     version 5.026 or higher.  (Lower versions have not been tested.)

  3. Run "make"

  4. If you need to build a static perl interpreter (used for
     the old XRT widgets ) run "make xperl".  This is a
     static version of the perl interpreter that has all of the X11
     modules built into it.  "xperl" still supports dynamic loading
     of other modules so it isn't necessary to link every module
     that you need into it. (This not tested with v1.9+.)

If everything builds properly, you will have a new "./blib" directory
with all the modules installed into it.  You can install this into
your perl site directory. Do be aware the software probably has
unknown bugs and may change in incompatible ways as it stabilizes more,
so be careful.

  6. If you really want to use the software, install the X11
     modules into your site directory by running "make install"

You can test the modules by running some of the scripts in the examples
directory.  In particular, try "xppcamshaft.pl" because that uses quite
a few different Motif widgets in a real-world example.  If you have a
minimal Perl installation, try "hello-world.pl" or "test.pl" for a tiny
demo.  There aren't any regression style tests, so don't try to run a
"make test".

If you find bugs, please create an issue on the Github project at
https://github.com/kbrannen/X11-Motif-Perl.  Include a typescript
session of the bug and the output of "perl -V".  If you run into
compilation errors, please send your config.pm along with the complete
output of make.

Documentation in "./doc" is far from complete, but it should enable
an experienced Motif programmer to start using the module.

Three areas where I could use additional help are writing widget
demonstrations, writing documentation and incorporating new widgets.
I'm spending most of my time writing documentation; the code itself is
fairly stable.

Any questions or comments?  Please send them to me via the GitHub project
at https://github.com/kbrannen/X11-Motif-Perl.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Things To Do (vaguely in this order):
-------------------------------------

* fix any known issues
* remove the few warnings created when compiling
* add more docs, especially POD
* add more examples (and or expand existing ones), especially the
  Motif v2.x ones
* verify we have all functions from Motif covered
* verify Mrm and UIL work and there are examples

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Known Issues:
-------------

* Xbae (v4.60) example sc.pl crashes.
* xppcamshaft.pl crashes.
