--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the third BETA release of a Perl interface to:

  * the X11 C library
  * the X11 Toolkit
  * the Xpm pixmap library
  * the OSF Motif widget set (version 1.2.4)
  * the Xbae widget set (used with Motif)
  * the XRT widget set (used with Motif)
  * the MIT Athena widget set (not yet available)

To build the release:

  1. Edit config.pm to customize the compilation options to your
     site.  The default configuration is for Solaris 2.5 with
     CDE.  The Athena module is not yet available.  (If you add
     it, please send me the patches!)

     If you are on a system that is not already defined in the
     config.pm, please send me the necessary changes so it is
     supported in a future release.  Thanks!

  2. Run "perl Makefile.PL".  Make sure that you are running perl
     version 5.004 or higher.  (Perl 5.005 has not been tested.)

  3. Run "make"

  4. If you need to build a static perl interpreter (you are using
     the XRT widgets for example) run "make xperl".  This is a
     static version of the perl interpreter that has all of the X11
     modules built into it.  "xperl" still supports dynamic loading
     of other modules so it isn't necessary to link every module
     that you need into it.

  5. If you are using the XRT widgets you must activate the XRT
     license embedded into the static perl built in step #4.  Run
     "xrt_auth xperl"

If everything builds properly, you will have a new "./blib" directory
with all the modules installed into it.  Please do not install this into
your perl site directory unless you are SURE you want to deal with beta
software.  The software probably has unknown bugs and may change in
incompatible ways.

  6. If you really want to use beta software, install the X11
     modules into your site directory by running "make install"

You can test the modules by running some of the scripts in the examples
directory.  In particular, try "xppcamshaft.pl" because that uses quite
a few different Motif widgets in a real-world example.  If you have a
minimal Perl installation, try "test.pl" for a tiny demo.  There aren't
any regression style tests, so don't try to run a "make test".

Please send bug reports to <fox@vulpes.com>.  Include a typescript
session of the bug and the output of "perl -V".  If you run into
compilation errors, please send your config.pm along with the complete
output of make.

Documentation in "./doc" is far from complete, but it should enable
an experienced Motif programmer to start using the module.

Three areas where I could use additional help are writing widget
demonstrations, writing documentation and incorporating new widgets.
I'm spending most of my time writing documentation; the code itself is
fairly stable.

Any questions or comments?  Please send them to <fox@vulpes.com>.
